# Sentimental-Analysis-using-LSTM

Done Sentimental Analysis using LSTM.


### Problem Overcame

The removal of stopwords sometimes leads to ambiguity for a model and the model underperforms for certain cases.

So by using LSTM which keep the sequence of words in a sentence improved the model performance in these cases.

### Technologies Used
```
1.RNN/LSTM

2.Keras

3.Tensorflow
